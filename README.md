# Sales Data Visualization Project

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes and visualizes a sales dataset using **Python** and **Matplotlib**.  
The visualizations aim to highlight sales trends, top-performing products, and revenue distribution without using any date-based analysis.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains the following key columns:
- **Product Name** – Name of the product sold.

1. **Top 10 Products by Total Revenue**  
   Displays the products that generated the highest total revenue.

2. **Top 10 Products by Units Sold**  
   Shows which products were sold in the highest quantities.

3. **Revenue Share by Category (Pie Chart)**  
   Illustrates the percentage contribution of each category to overall revenue.

4. **Average Unit Price by Category**  
   Highlights the pricing differences between categories.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python** (Core Programming Language)
- **Matplotlib** – For data visualization
- **Pandas** – For data manipulation
